**Review Sentimental Analysis**

The client is in business of online sales of jwellery items through website & also TV channels in USA, UK & Australia. They recieve multiple feedback for their product from all the channels like website, TV chaannels etc

The client do not have huge database of the reviews of their product. Since there was lack of data for training the model we took transfer learning approach to solve it .

We scraped  jwellery data from amazon review dataset 2018. It was around 14GB json file.
