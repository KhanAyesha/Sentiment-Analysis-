**Review Sentimental Analysis**

The client is in business of online sales of jewellery items through website & also TV channels in USA, UK & Australia. They recieve multiple feedback for their product from all the channels like website, TV chaannels etc .The client do not have huge database of the reviews of their product. Since there was lack of data for training the model we took transfer learning approach to solve it .We scraped  jewellery data from amazon review dataset 2018. It was around 14GB json file. Class 1 – The review is positive. Class 0 – The review is negative.

Finally, we end up with all the steps. Now suppose you have to predict if a review is positive apply all the transformation methods, and finally give it to your model, your model will basically say whether your 0 or 1 means review is positive or not.
